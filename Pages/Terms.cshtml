                <h5 class="fw-semibold mt-4">1. Scope of Services</h5>

                    Kairos Technologies provides independent residential IT support including troubleshooting,
                    device setup, home network configuration, software assistance, and remote or on-site support.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Services are provided for residential clients only. Business IT services,
                    managed services, and enterprise support are not offered.
                </p>

                <h5 class="fw-semibold mt-4">2. No Guarantee of Data Preservation</h5>
                <p>
                    Clients are responsible for backing up their data before service begins.
                    While reasonable care is taken, Kairos Technologies is not responsible for data loss,
                    file corruption, or hardware failure occurring during or after service.

                    To the maximum extent permitted by law, liability is limited to the amount paid
                    for the specific service provided.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Kairos Technologies is not liable for indirect, incidental, or consequential damages,
                    including loss of data or loss of use.

                <h5 class="fw-semibold mt-4">4. Remote Support Authorization</h5>
                <p>
                    By requesting remote assistance, you authorize temporary remote access to your device
                    for the purpose of performing the requested work. You may terminate the session at any time.
                </p>

                <h5 class="fw-semibold mt-4">5. On-Site Services</h5>
                <p>
                    For in-home visits, clients are responsible for providing a safe working environment.
                    Pre-existing device damage or unrelated hardware failures discovered during service
                    are not the responsibility of Kairos Technologies.
                </p>

                <h5 class="fw-semibold mt-4">6. Payment Terms</h5>
                <p>
                    Service fees are communicated prior to or at the beginning of service.
                    Payment is due upon completion unless otherwise agreed.
                    Diagnostic fees may apply regardless of outcome.
                </p>

                <h5 class="fw-semibold mt-4">7. No Warranty</h5>

                    Services are provided on an as-is basis without guarantees of permanent issue resolution,
                    compatibility with third-party software, or continued performance of aging hardware.
                </p>

                <h5 class="fw-semibold mt-4">8. Governing Law</h5>
